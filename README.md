# PLM Study
A large and continuing literature study, based on relevant publications in the filed of PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) and other reserach domains. 
The project includes 
 * the tools to process the information from a literature database, 
 * the database,
 * and a web project to visualise the data.

## Authors
This project has been initially created by

* Felix Nyffenegger, HSR, Rapperswil, Switzerland
* Louis Rivest, ETS, Montreal, Canada
* Christian Braesch, Univ. Savoie Mont-Blanc - SYMME, Annecy, France

## Brief overview of the Method

## Project structure

This project is devided into 4 sub projects:

* __database__: in this folder we find the original zotero database, all the normalization files, and the final database generated by the dbgenerator. The main source to this project is a Zotero literatur database (https://www.zotero.org/) containing all publicaitons, that sould be analyzed.

* __dbgenerator__: a java project, that takes thre orginal zotero database, and the normalization files and generates a normalized database. After processing, the tool will write delta files that log all missing keywords, acronyms, coutries and sources. In order to complete the proper database, these missing terms must be added to the according nromalization files. This subproject reqies java (https://www.java.com), if you are using eclipse, the project files will be found in this directory, too.

* __gephi__: The tool gephi (https://gephi.org/) or equivialent must be used to calcucate the network, degeree of each node, a number of other statisics and the inital layout of the graph (position, size and color of nodes and edges as the will be loaded by the website). Once everything is done in gephy, the graph must be exported to the website/data directory in the GEXF format.

* __website__: This is a node.js webserver containing backend and frontend for the viszalization of the data. The databases and the gefx files must be copied into the /data folder, in oder to be found by the website. This
